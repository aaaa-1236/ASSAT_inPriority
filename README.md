#ASSAT_inPriority  
We implement a specialized SAT solver for solving the preferred extensions problem , and configure it on state-of-the-art abstract argumentation algorithm ArgSemSAT(abbr. ASSAT). 

ArgSemSAT is the winner of the preferred semantics track of the [International Competition of Computational Models of Argumentation 2017](http://argumentationcompetition.org/2017/index.html)
